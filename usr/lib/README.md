## What is this?
## I've noticed (by using perf) that certain pdfs load and change pages a lot faster with the latest version of [lcms](http://www.littlecms.com)

you can copy this one to `/usr/lib` or compile it from source
```
ln -sf /usr/lib/liblcms2.so.2.0.8 /usr/lib/liblcms2.so
ln -sf /usr/lib/liblcms2.so.2.0.8 /usr/lib/liblcms2.so.2

```
